Rocket league replay parsing and analytics

A Python program that uses Construct to parse rocket league replay files. Current version can parse the entire file except for the network stream, which it skips. Sample replays are given in the replays folder, and corresponding parser output can be seen in the output folder. At present, output just prints the context dictionary to the output file.
