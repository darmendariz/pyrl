##### ARRAY PROPERTY ########
In the header properties, this algorithm will read arrays of the ArrayProperty type

An array in the header is a main array consisting of dicts of key-value pairs.
The main array is prefixed with its element count, but the dicts it contains are not. 

1. Read main array size. This will tell you how many dicts there are.
2. Read dict of key-value pairs. These dicts are NOT prefixed with their element count. Rather, they use a key of 'None' to mark the end of that dict. 
3. To read a dict, keep reading key-value pairs until a key that is the string 'None' is read. If the KEY is 'None', then that marks the end of that dict. 
        Note that some pairs can have keys which are NOT 'None', yet have VALUES which are 'None'. (Ex: key='BallName', value_type='NameProperty', value='None'). That is fine and does not mark the end of the dict. It must be the key itself that is 'None' in order to indicate the end of the dict. 
4. Begin to read next dict by recursing into Step 2. Repeat until the number of dicts given as the prefix to the main array is reached. This number of dicts should come right after 'ArrayProperty'.
